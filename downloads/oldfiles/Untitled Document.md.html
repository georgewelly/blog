<h2><a id="Problem_Solving_and_Being_Lazy_0"></a>“Problem Solving and Being Lazy”</h2>
<p>I’ve been sorted into group two, first presentation is “Problem Solving and Being Lazy”, led by Billy Mayor.This presentation was all about software engineering, how to manage problems and making them efficient (“being lazy”). Why write code to do a job multiple times when one could write a function and save 20 lines of code and time as well? When problem solving, we should treat all our problems with a to-do list like RAM, when we stop doing work, we should put our remaining problems into swapspace, or on a piece of paper. This makes for very efficient problem solving.</p>
<p>From this presentation, I learned about writing in markdown form, for easy conversion from text to code.<br>
For example, I can write in <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em>, and create</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bullet point</p>
<p>and</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>numbered lists</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwords I will convert this to php through markup, currently it is being written on the text editor “Kate” in “Kubuntu”.
We launched the operating system “Kubuntu” from a memory stick, as it provides more freedom when programming</p>
<p>I am learning about PHP from the github page <a href="https://github.com/CodeGuild-co/base-php">here</a>.</p>
